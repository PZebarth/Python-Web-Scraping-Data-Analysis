# Web-Scrapping-Data-Analysis
I used two files to gather data:
- twitter-archive-enhanced.csv (contained @dog_rates twitter incomplete archive)
- image_predictions.tsv (contained dog breed predictions from a neural network)

I scrapped the remaining information off of twitter's API and combined it into:
- tweet_json.txt (contained tweet id, retweet count, favourite count)

You can follow my code in the file wrangle_act.ipynb, my thought process in wrangle_report.ipynb, and my conclusions in act_report.ipynb
